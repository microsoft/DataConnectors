# TripPin Part 4 - Data Source Paths
This multi-part tutorial covers the creation of a new data source extension for Power Query. The tutorial is meant to be done sequentially – each lesson builds on the connector created in previous lessons, incrementally adding new capabilities to your connector. 

In this lesson, you will:

* Simplify the connection logic for our connector
* Improve the navigation table experience
 
This lesson simplifies the connector built in the [previous lesson](../3-NavTables) by removing its required function parameters, and improving the user experience by moving to a dynamically generated navigation table.
