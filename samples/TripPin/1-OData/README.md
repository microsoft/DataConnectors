# TripPin Part 1 - Data Connector for an OData Service
This multi-part tutorial covers the creation of a new data source extension for Power Query. The tutorial is meant to be done sequentially – each lesson builds on the connector created in previous lessons, incrementally adding new capabilities to your connector. 

In this lesson, you will:
* Create a new Data Connector project using the Visual Studio SDK
* Author a base function to pull data from a source
* Test your connector in Visual Studio
* Register your connector in Power BI Desktop

Please follow the tutorial at Microsoft Docs for Power Query here.
