# MyGraph Connector Sample
In this sample we will create a basic data source connector for [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/). It is written as a walk-through that you can follow step by step.

To access Graph, you will first need to register your own Azure Active Directory client application. If you do not have an application ID already, you can create one through the [Getting Started with Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/getting-started) site.
Click the "Universal Windows" option, and then the "Let's go" button. Follow the steps and receive an App ID. As described in the steps below, use `https://oauth.powerbi.com/views/oauthredirect.html` as your redirect URI when registering your app. 
Client ID value, use it to replace the existing value in the `client_id` file in the code sample. Also create a password and replace the existing value in the `client_secret` file with it. You can then jump straight to section [Creating your Graph Connector](https://github.com/ImkeF/DataConnectors/tree/master/samples/MyGraph#creating-your-graph-connector) to quickly set this up.

## Writing an OAuth v2 Flow with Power BI Desktop
There are three parts to implementing your OAuth Flow:
1. Creating the URL for the Authorization endpoint
2. Posting a code to the Token endpoint and extracting the auth and refresh tokens
3. Trading a refresh token for a new auth token 

We will use Power Query (via Power BI Desktop) to write the M for the Graph OAuth flow.

Review details about how the OAuth v2 flow works for Graph:
* [Microsoft Graph App authentication using Azure AD](https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/docs/authorization/app_authorization)
* [Authentication Code Grant Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code)
* [Permission scopes](https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/docs/authorization/permission_scopes)

You'll also want to download and install [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) to help trace the raw HTTP requests you make while developing the extension.

To get started create a new blank query in Power BI Desktop, and bring up the advanced query editor. 

Define the following variables that will be used in your OAuth flow:

```
let
    client_id = "<your app id>",
    redirect_uri = "https://oauth.powerbi.com/views/oauthredirect.html",
    token_uri = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token",
    authorize_uri = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize",
    logout_uri = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/logout.srf"
in
    logout_uri
```

Set the `client_id` with the app id you received when you registered your Graph application.

Graph has an extensive list of permission scopes that your application can request. For this sample, the app will request all scopes that do not require admin consent. We will define two more variables – a list of the scopes we want, and the prefix string that graph uses. We'll also add a couple of helper functions to convert the scope list into the expected format.

```
scope_prefix = "https://graph.microsoft.com/",
scopes = {
    "User.ReadWrite",
    "Contacts.Read",
    "User.ReadBasic.All",
    "Calendars.ReadWrite",
    "Mail.ReadWrite",
    "Mail.Send",
    "Contacts.ReadWrite",
    "Files.ReadWrite",
    "Tasks.ReadWrite",
    "People.Read",
    "Notes.ReadWrite.All",
    "Sites.Read.All"
},
Value.IfNull = (a, b) => if a <> null then a else b,

GetScopeString = (scopes as list, optional scopePrefix as text) as text =>
    let
        prefix = Value.IfNull(scopePrefix, ""),
        addPrefix = List.Transform(scopes, each prefix & _),
        asText = Text.Combine(addPrefix, " ")
    in
        asText,
```

The GetScopeString function will end up generating a scope string which looks like this:
`https://graph.microsoft.com/User.ReadWrite https://graph.microsoft.com/Contacts.Read https://graph.microsoft.com/User.ReadBasic.All ...`

You will need to set [several query string parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code) as part of the authorization URL. We can use the `Uri.BuildQueryString` function to properly encode the parameter names and values. Construct the URL by concatenating the `authorize_uri` variable and query string parameters.

The full code sample is below. 

```
let
    client_id = "<your app id>",
    redirect_uri = "urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob",
    token_uri = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token",
    authorize_uri = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize",
    logout_uri = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/logout.srf",

    scope_prefix = "https://graph.microsoft.com/",
    scopes = {
        "User.ReadWrite",
        "Contacts.Read",
        "User.ReadBasic.All",
        "Calendars.ReadWrite",
        "Mail.ReadWrite",
        "Mail.Send",
        "Contacts.ReadWrite",
        "Files.ReadWrite",
        "Tasks.ReadWrite",
        "People.Read",
        "Notes.ReadWrite.All",
        "Sites.Read.All"
    },

    Value.IfNull = (a, b) => if a <> null then a else b,

    GetScopeString = (scopes as list, optional scopePrefix as text) as text =>
        let
            prefix = Value.IfNull(scopePrefix, ""),
            addPrefix = List.Transform(scopes, each prefix & _),
            asText = Text.Combine(addPrefix, " ")
        in
            asText,

    authorizeUrl = authorize_uri & "?" & Uri.BuildQueryString([
        client_id = client_id,  
        redirect_uri = redirect_uri,      
        scope = GetScopeString(scopes, scope_prefix),
        response_type = "code",
        response_mode = "query",
        login = "login"    
    ])
in
    authorizeUrl
```

Close the Advanced Query Editor to see the generated authorization URL. 

![authorizeUrl value in Power BI Desktop](../../blobs/graph1.png)

Launch [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) and copy and paste the URL into the browser of your choice. 

> **You will need to configure Fiddler to decrypt HTTPS traffic and skip decryption for the following hosts: `msft.sts.microsoft.com`**

Entering the URL should bring up the standard Azure Active Directory login page. Complete the auth flow using your regular credentials, and then look at the fiddler trace.
You'll be interested in the lines with a status of 302 and a host value of login.microsoftonline.com. 

![Fiddler trace of AAD auth flow](../../blobs/graph2.png)

Click on the request to `/login.srf` and view the Headers of the Response.
Under Transport, you will find a location header with the `redirect_uri` value you specified in your code, and a query string containing a very long code value.\
Extract the code value only, and paste it into your M query as a new variable.
Note, the header value will also contain a `&session_state=xxxx` query string value at the end – remove this part from the code.
Also, be sure to include double quotes around the value after you paste it into the advanced query editor. 

To exchange the code for an auth token we will need to create a POST request to the token endpoint.
We'll do this using the `Web.Contents` call, and use the `Uri.BuildQueryString` function to format our input parameters.
The code will look like this:

```
tokenResponse = Web.Contents(token_uri, [
    Content = Text.ToBinary(Uri.BuildQueryString([
        client_id = client_id,
        code = code,
        scope = GetScopeString(scopes, scope_prefix),
        grant_type = "authorization_code",
        redirect_uri = redirect_uri])),
    Headers = [
        #"Content-type" = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
        #"Accept" = "application/json"
    ]
]),

jsonResponse = Json.Document(tokenResponse)
```

When you return the jsonResponse, Power Query will likely prompt you for credentials. Choose Anonymous, and click OK. 

![Authentication prompt](../../blobs/graph3.png)

The authentication code returned by AAD has a short timeout – probably shorter than the time it took you to do the previous steps.
If your code has expired, you will see a response like this:

![Error for expired code](../../blobs/graph4.png)

If you check the fiddler trace you will see a more detailed error message in the JSON body of the response related to timeout.
Later in this sample we'll update our code so that end users will be able to see the detailed error messages instead of the generic 400 Bad Request error.
Try the authentication process again (you will likely want your browser to be In Private mode to avoid any stored auth info).
Capture the `Location` header, and update your M query with the new code value.
Run the query again, and you should see a parsed record containing an `access_token` value. 

![access_token example](../../blobs/graph5.png)

You now have the raw code you'll need to implement your OAuth flow. 
As an optional step, you can improve the error handling of your OAuth code by using the `ManualStatusHandling` option to `Web.Contents`.
This will let us process the body of an error response (which is a json document with [error] and [error_description] fields),
rather than displaying a `DataSource.Error` to the user. The updated code looks like this:

```
tokenResponse = Web.Contents(token_uri, [
    Content = Text.ToBinary(Uri.BuildQueryString([
        client_id = client_id,
        code = code,
        scope = GetScopeString(scopes, scope_prefix),
        grant_type = "authorization_code",
        redirect_uri = redirect_uri])),
    Headers = [
        #"Content-type" = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
        #"Accept" = "application/json"
    ],
    ManualStatusHandling = {400} 
]),
body = Json.Document(tokenResponse),
result = if (Record.HasFields(body, {"error", "error_description"})) then 
            error Error.Record(body[error], body[error_description], body)
         else
            body
```

Run your query again and you will receive an error (because your code was already exchanged for an auth token). This time you should see the full detailed error message from the service, rather than a generic 400 status code.

## Creating Your Graph Connector
Take a copy of the code contained within this sample, and open the MyGraph.mproj project file in Visual Studio. Update the `client_id` file with the AAD client_id you received when you registered your own app.
You'll likely notice that the code is very similar to the OAuth sample code above, with some key differences that will be described below. There are also slight formatting differences due to the code being within a section document (rather than query expression). 

Another difference is the `MyGraph.Feed` function. This will be the data source function we'll expose to the engine. We'll be adding our logic to access and read Graph data in here. We've associated the function with the `MyGraph` Data Source Kind, and exposed it in the UI using the MyGraph.UI record (`[DataSource.Kind="MyGraph", Publish="MyGraph.UI"]`). 

Since our data source function has no required arguments, it acts as a `Singleton` data source credential type.
This means that a user will have a single credential for the data source, and that the credential is not dependent on any of the parameters supplied to the function. 

We've declared that `OAuth` as one of our supported credential types and provided function names for the OAuth interface functions. 

```
[DataSource.Kind="MyGraph", Publish="MyGraph.UI"]
MyGraph.Feed = () =>
    let
        source = OData.Feed("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/", null, [ ODataVersion = 4, MoreColumns = true ])
    in
        source;

//
// Data Source definition
//
MyGraph = [
    Authentication = [
        OAuth = [
            StartLogin=StartLogin,
            FinishLogin=FinishLogin,
            Refresh=Refresh,
            Logout=Logout
        ]
    ],
    Label = "My Graph Connector"
];

//
// UI Export definition
//
MyGraph.UI = [
    Beta = true,
    ButtonText = { "MyGraph.Feed", "Connect to Graph" },
    SourceImage = MyGraph.Icons,
    SourceTypeImage = MyGraph.Icons
];
```

## Implementing the OAuth Interface
The code that we wrote to test out the Graph OAuth flow in Power BI Desktop won't work in the connector as-is, but at least we've proven that it works (which is generally the trickiest part).
We'll now reformat the code to file into the four functions expected by the M Engine's OAuth interface:

1. StartLogin
2. FinishLogin
3. Refresh
4. Logout

### StartLogin
The first function we'll implement is `StartLogin`.
This function will create the Authorization URL that will be sent to users to initiate their 
OAuth flow. The function signature must look like this:
```
StartLogin = (resourceUrl, state, display) as record
```
It is expected to return a record with all the fields that Power BI will need to initiate an OAuth flow.

Since our data source function has no required parameters, we won't be making use of the `resourceUrl` value. If our data source function required a user supply URL or sub-domain name, then this is where it would be passed to us.
The `State` parameter includes a blob of state information that we're expected to include in the URL.
We will not need to use the `display` value at all.
The body of the function will look a lot like the `authorizeUrl` variable you created earlier in this sample – 
the main difference will be the inclusion of the `state` parameter (which is used to prevent [replay attacks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols-oauth-code)).

```
StartLogin = (resourceUrl, state, display) =>
    let
        authorizeUrl = authorize_uri & "?" & Uri.BuildQueryString([
            client_id = client_id,  
            redirect_uri = redirect_uri,
            state = state,
            scope = GetScopeString(scopes, scope_prefix),
            response_type = "code",
            response_mode = "query",
            login = "login"    
        ])
    in
        [
            LoginUri = authorizeUrl,
            CallbackUri = redirect_uri,
            WindowHeight = 720,
            WindowWidth = 1024,
            Context = null
        ];
```

### FinishLogin
The `FinishLogin` function will be called once the user has completed their OAuth flow. Its signature looks like this:
```
FinishLogin = (context, callbackUri, state) as record
```

The `context` parameter will contain any value set in the Context field of the record returned by `StartLogin`.
Typically this will be a tenant ID or other identifier that was extracted from the original resource URL.
The `callbackUri` parameter contains the redirect value in the `Location` header, which we'll parse to extract the code value.
The third parameter (`state`) can be used to round-trip state information to the service – we won't need to use it for AAD. 

We will use the `Uri.Parts` function to break apart the `callbackUri` value. For the AAD auth flow, all we'll care about is the code parameter in the query string. 

```
FinishLogin = (context, callbackUri, state) =>
    let
        parts = Uri.Parts(callbackUri)[Query],
        result = if (Record.HasFields(parts, {"error", "error_description"})) then 
                    error Error.Record(parts[error], parts[error_description], parts)
                 else
                    TokenMethod("authorization_code", "code", parts[code])
    in
        result;
```

If the response doesn't contain `error` fields, we pass the `code` query string parameter from the `Location` header to the `TokenMethod` function.

The `TokenMethod` function converts the `code` to an `access_token`. It is not a direct part of the OAuth interface, but it provides all the heavy lifting for the `FinishLogin` and `Refresh` functions. Its implementation is essentially the tokenResponse logic we created earlier with one small addition – we'll use a grantType variable rather than hardcoding the value to "authorization_code".

```
TokenMethod = (grantType, tokenField, code) =>
    let
        queryString = [
            client_id = client_id,
            scope = GetScopeString(scopes, scope_prefix),
            grant_type = grantType,
            redirect_uri = redirect_uri
        ],
        queryWithCode = Record.AddField(queryString, tokenField, code),

        tokenResponse = Web.Contents(token_uri, [
            Content = Text.ToBinary(Uri.BuildQueryString(queryWithCode)),
            Headers = [
                #"Content-type" = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
                #"Accept" = "application/json"
            ],
            ManualStatusHandling = {400} 
        ]),
        body = Json.Document(tokenResponse),
        result = if (Record.HasFields(body, {"error", "error_description"})) then 
                    error Error.Record(body[error], body[error_description], body)
                 else
                    body
    in
        result;
```

### Refresh
This function is called when the `access_token` expires – Power Query will use the `refresh_token` to retrieve a new `access_token`. The implementation here is just a call to `TokenMethod`, passing in the refresh token value rather than the code.

```
Refresh = (resourceUrl, refresh_token) => TokenMethod("refresh_token", "refresh_token", refresh_token);
```

### Logout
The last function we need to implement is Logout. The logout implementation for AAD is very simple – we just return a fixed URL. 

```
Logout = (token) => logout_uri;
```

## Testing the Data Source Function
`MyGraph.Feed` contains your actual data source function logic. Since Graph is an OData v4 service, we can leverage the built-in OData.Feed function to do all the hard work for us (including query folding and generating a navigation table!).

```
[DataSource.Kind="MyGraph", Publish="MyGraph.UI"]
MyGraph.Feed = () =>
    let
        source = OData.Feed("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/", null, [ ODataVersion = 4, MoreColumns = true ])
    in
        source;
```

Once your function is updated, make sure there are no syntax errors in your code (look for red squiggles). Also be sure to update your `client_id` file with your own AAD app ID. If there are no errors, open the MyGraph.query.m file. 

The `<project>.query.m` file lets you test out your extension. You (currently) don’t get the same navigation table / query building experience you get in Power BI Desktop, but does provide a quick way to test out your code. 

A query to test your data source function would be:

```
MyGraph.Feed()
```

Click the Start (Debug) button to execute the query.

Since this is the first time you are accessing your new data source, you will receive a credential prompt.

![Credential prompt in visual studio](../../blobs/graph7.png)

Select OAuth2 from the Credential Type drop down, and click Login. This will popup your OAuth flow. After completing your flow, you should see a large blob (your token). Click the Set Credential button at the bottom of the dialog, and close the MQuery Output window.

![Setting credentials](../../blobs/graph8.png)

Run the query again. This time you should get a spinning progress dialog, and a query result window.

![Graph query results](../../blobs/graph9.png)

You can now build your project in Visual Studio to create a compiled extension file, and deploy it to your Custom Connectors directory. Your new data source should now appear in the Get Data dialog the next time you launch Power BI Desktop.
